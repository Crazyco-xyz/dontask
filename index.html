            <h1>Don't ask. Just don't bother!</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the internet, where time is valuable, attention spans are fleeting, and your question... 
                well, might not even be worth asking. Before you even think about typing, let's get one thing straight: 
				<b>Just don't bother!</b><br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Why not?</h2>
            <p>
	            Look, we know you've got questions, but have you ever considered that the universe is vast and your 
	            question is... probably not? There are some things better left unanswered, or better yet, <b>unasked</b>.<br><br>
	            Think about it: is your question going to change the world? Or is it just another "<i>Can you Google this 
	            for me? </i>" moment? Exactly.
	        </p>

	        <h2>Scenarios Where You Shouldn't Bother:</h2>
	        <ol>
		        <li><b>You're not sure if your question makes sense:</b> Spoiler alert: It doesn't. You already know that, 
		        	which is why you're hesitating. Trust your instincts.</li><br>
		        	
	        	<li><b>The answer is painfully obvious:</b> Yes, you can Google it. No, we won't judge you for not trying.
	        		But we will judge you for asking here.</li><br>
	        		
	        	<li><b>You don't care that much:</b> If your curiosity level is below "mildly intrigued", we can guarantee 
	        		that the answer won't be that satisfying. Just... move on with your day.</li><br>
	        		
	        	<li><b>You already asked someone else:</b> And they didn't respond. Take the hint. Maybe your question 
	        		didn't need to be answered after all. Or maybe they're just as confused as you are.</li><br>
	        </ol>

	        <h2>But I Really Want to Ask!</h2>
	        <p>
	        	You could ask. Sure. But you know what would be more productive? Not asking. Here's why:
		        <ul>
	        		<li><b>It's a waste of time:</b> Mostly yours. And ours. And anyone else's who stumbles across your 
	        				existential quandary.</li><br>
	        		
	        		<li><b>The internet has enough clutter:</b> Let's not add to the noise. Do you want to be remembered 
	        				as the person who asked whether fish get thirsty? Didn't think so.</li><br>
	        				
	        		<li><b>The satisfaction isn't real:</b> That fleeting moment of gratification when someone responds? 
	        				Yeah, it'll vanish in seconds. You'll still have that empty feeling inside.</li><br>
				</ul>
			</p>

	        <h2>Alternatives to Asking:</h2>
	        <ol>
	        	<li><b>Google it:</b> We said it before, but we mean it. The search bar is right there, waiting. It's free.</li><br>
	        
	        	<li><b>Just guess:</b> You'll probably be 70% right, and 100% satisfied that you didn't bother anyone with it.</li><br>
	        
	        	<li><b>Forget about it:</b> Seriously, just let it go. You'll live longer and be more mysterious for never 
	        			knowing the answer.</li><br>
			</ol>
				        
	        <h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
	        <p>
	        	At the end of the day, life is full of unasked questions, and that's okay. It's the way it's meant to be. 
	        	So, before you hit that "Ask" button, take a deep breath, and say to yourself: <b>"Don't ask. Just don't bother."</b>
